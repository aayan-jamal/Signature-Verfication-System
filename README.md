# Signature verification System



This is a Python-based Signature Verification System that uses various libraries to authenticate and verify signatures. The system allows users to compare their signature with a stored sample to check for authenticity.

## Libraries Used
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Numpy**: For handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- **OS**: For interacting with the operating system.
- **CV2 (OpenCV)**: For image processing and capturing signatures.
- **Math**: For mathematical operations involved in signature comparison.

## Files
1. **main.py**: The main file that runs the application. It contains the logic for signature capture, comparison, and authentication.
2. **signature.py**: This file contains the functions responsible for signature processing, feature extraction, and verification.
